This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Create a version of this page in Next JS using Tailwind CSS. The accordions should be functional. Figma: https://figma.com/file/1HsGxT1oDS3XnD1haQbzVB/Frontend-Dev-Test?node-id=0:1
The font used is available on Google Fonts.
Extra Credit

- Build the page to respond in a way that you see fit.
- Build the background gradient to animate in a way that you consider to be cool.
  To have access to this figma you need to be whitelisted, so provide please your email for whitelisting.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
